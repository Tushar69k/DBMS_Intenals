## What are File Attributes?
In Unix (and Linux), **file attributes** are special properties or settings that control how files behave. They tell the system and users **what can be done** with the file ‚Äî like who can read it, who can write to it, and who can execute (run) it.

---

## The Basic File Attributes
When you list files in a directory using `ls -l`, you see something like this:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4096 Apr 29 09:00 example.txt
```

Let‚Äôs understand this part-by-part:

### 1. **File Type and Permissions (`-rw-r--r--`)**
This is **10 characters** long:

- **First character** shows the **type of file**:
  - `-` : Regular file (like a document or program)
  - `d` : Directory (folder)
  - `l` : Link (shortcut to another file)
  - `c` : Character device (for hardware like keyboard)
  - `b` : Block device (for storage like hard disk)

- **Next 9 characters** are **permissions**, divided into 3 sets:
  - First 3 characters (`rw-`) = permissions for **Owner** (the person who created the file)
  - Next 3 (`r--`) = permissions for **Group** (a set of users)
  - Last 3 (`r--`) = permissions for **Others** (everyone else)

Each character means:
  - `r` = read (can open/view the file)
  - `w` = write (can edit or delete the file)
  - `x` = execute (can run the file if it‚Äôs a program)
  - `-` = no permission

**Example:**  
`rw-` = read and write allowed, but not execute.

---

### 2. **Number of Links (`1`)**
This shows **how many links** point to this file. (Think of it like "shortcuts" to the file.)

---

### 3. **Owner Name (`user`)**
This shows the **username** of the person who owns the file.

---

### 4. **Group Name (`group`)**
This shows the **group name** that the file belongs to. Groups allow you to manage permissions for multiple users easily.

---

### 5. **File Size (`4096`)**
This is the **size of the file in bytes**.

---

### 6. **Last Modified Date and Time (`Apr 29 09:00`)**
This shows **when the file was last edited**.

---

### 7. **File Name (`example.txt`)**
Finally, the name of the file!

---

## Special Attributes (Advanced but easy to understand)
Unix also allows **special file attributes** that change behavior beyond normal permissions. You can set them using `chattr` command.

Examples:
- **i (immutable)**: You **cannot modify, delete, or rename** the file if this is set.
- **a (append-only)**: You can **only add** to the file, not remove anything.
- **t (no tail-merging)**: Used in specific filesystems to protect file contents.

You can check special attributes using `lsattr` command.

---

## Quick Summary
| Part | Meaning |
|:----|:------|
| `-` | Type of file |
| `rw-` | Owner can read and write |
| `r--` | Group can only read |
| `r--` | Others can only read |
| `1` | Number of links |
| `user` | Owner of file |
| `group` | Group of file |
| `4096` | File size in bytes |
| `Apr 29 09:00` | Last modified time |
| `example.txt` | File name |

# Filters in Unix (Detailed and Simple)

---

## What is a Filter?

In Unix, a **filter** is a **program that takes some data (input), does something to it (processing), and gives back the result (output)**.

- **Input** ‚Üí **Filter** ‚Üí **Output**

Just like a **water filter**:
- Dirty water goes in ‚Üí Clean water comes out.

In Unix:
- Raw data (input) goes into a filter ‚Üí Processed or cleaned data comes out.

---

## Why are Filters Useful?

- **They save time** ‚Äî No need to edit files manually.
- **They work automatically** ‚Äî They handle very big files quickly.
- **They can be combined** ‚Äî You can use many filters together to do complex tasks easily.
- **They are simple** ‚Äî Each filter does one small job, very well.

---

## How do Filters Work in Unix?

Filters **usually**:

- Read data from **Standard Input** (like from a file or another command).
- Write the processed result to **Standard Output** (like your screen or another command).

**Standard Input** = Where the command gets its data from.  
**Standard Output** = Where the command sends the result.

You can also **connect** filters using a **pipe (`|`)** symbol.  
This passes the output of one command **directly into** another command.

Example:

```bash
cat data.txt | sort | uniq
```

- `cat` reads the file
- `sort` arranges the lines
- `uniq` removes repeated lines

Each filter works one after another, automatically!

---

## Some Important Unix Filters (Explained Very Simply)

Let‚Äôs go through some of the **most used filters**:

| Filter | What it does | Easy Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `cat` | Shows the content of a file | `cat file.txt` shows all lines in the file |
| `sort` | Sorts lines alphabetically or numerically | `sort names.txt` sorts the names A-Z |
| `uniq` | Removes repeated lines | `uniq sorted_names.txt` removes duplicate names |
| `wc` | Counts lines, words, and characters | `wc file.txt` tells you how big the file is |
| `grep` | Searches for specific words or patterns | `grep "apple" fruits.txt` finds all lines with "apple" |
| `cut` | Cuts out sections (columns) from a file | `cut -d',' -f1 data.csv` shows only the first column (before the comma) |
| `tr` | Changes or replaces characters | `tr a-z A-Z` changes all small letters to capital |
| `head` | Shows the first few lines of a file | `head file.txt` shows first 10 lines |
| `tail` | Shows the last few lines of a file | `tail file.txt` shows last 10 lines |

---

### Let's see a few filters in action with examples:

1. **`cat`** ‚Äì View a file:

```bash
cat groceries.txt
```
Output:
```
milk
bread
apple
apple
banana
milk
```

---

2. **`sort`** ‚Äì Sort the list:

```bash
sort groceries.txt
```
Output:
```
apple
apple
banana
bread
milk
milk
```

---

3. **`uniq`** ‚Äì Remove duplicates:

**First**, you should sort before using `uniq`!

```bash
sort groceries.txt | uniq
```
Output:
```
apple
banana
bread
milk
```

---

4. **`grep`** ‚Äì Find specific word:

```bash
grep "milk" groceries.txt
```
Output:
```
milk
milk
```

---

5. **`wc`** ‚Äì Count lines, words, characters:

```bash
wc groceries.txt
```
Output:
```
6  6  33 groceries.txt
```
Here:
- `6` = number of lines
- `6` = number of words
- `33` = number of characters

---

6. **Using multiple filters together:**

Suppose you want to:
- Find all "apple" entries
- Sort them
- Remove duplicates

You can use:

```bash
grep "apple" groceries.txt | sort | uniq
```
This will:
- Search for "apple"
- Sort them
- Remove any repeated "apple" lines

---

## Key Concepts to Remember

| Term | Simple meaning |
|:---|:---|
| **Input** | Data going into the filter |
| **Processing** | What the filter does to the data |
| **Output** | The result after filtering |
| **Pipe (`|`)** | Sends output from one command as input to another |

---

# Final Example - Big Picture

Suppose you have a **huge log file** from a server (server_logs.txt) and you want to:

- Find all lines containing "error"
- Sort those lines
- Remove duplicate error messages
- Count how many different errors happened

You could write:

```bash
grep "error" server_logs.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

This entire line uses **four filters**, linked together with pipes, to quickly and easily get the answer.

---

# Summary

- **Filters** take input ‚Üí process it ‚Üí give output.
- Filters can be **combined** using pipes (`|`) to create powerful tools.
- Some common filters are `cat`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `wc`, `cut`, `tr`, `head`, `tail`.
- They make Unix very powerful and flexible for handling text and data.

#  The `vi` Editor in Unix (Detailed and Simple)

---

## What is `vi`?

- `vi` stands for "**Visual Editor**."
- It is a **text editor** ‚Äî a tool to **create**, **edit**, and **save** text files.
- It is very **popular** because:
  - It is **always available** on Unix/Linux systems.
  - It is **fast**, even on old computers.
  - It uses only the **keyboard**, not the mouse.

**Example:**  
If you want to write a program in Unix or change a system file, you often use `vi`.

---

## Two Main Modes in `vi`

**Important:** `vi` has two working styles, called **modes**:

| Mode | Purpose | What you do |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Command Mode** | Give commands (save, delete, move) | Not writing text, only controlling |
| **Insert Mode** | Write text | You can type like in Notepad |

**At start:**  
- When you open `vi`, you are in **Command Mode**.
- You must **press `i`** to **go into Insert Mode** to start typing.

---

## How to Open and Create Files with `vi`

If you want to **open a file** or **create a new one**, type:

```bash
vi filename.txt
```

- If the file exists, it opens it.
- If it doesn‚Äôt exist, `vi` creates a new file.

---

## Moving Around in `vi`

In **Command Mode** (after pressing `Esc`):

| Key | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `h` | Move cursor left |
| `l` | Move cursor right |
| `j` | Move cursor down |
| `k` | Move cursor up |

You **navigate** the file using just the keyboard.

---

## Important Commands in `vi`

| Action | Command | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Start typing | Press `i` | Go into Insert Mode |
| Save file | Press `Esc`, then type `:w` | Write (save) the file |
| Quit `vi` | Press `Esc`, then type `:q` | Quit (only if no changes) |
| Save and quit | Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` | Save and exit |
| Quit without saving | Press `Esc`, then type `:q!` | Force quit without saving |
| Delete a line | In Command Mode, type `dd` | Deletes the whole line |
| Copy a line | In Command Mode, type `yy` | Copies (yanks) a line |
| Paste copied line | In Command Mode, type `p` | Pastes below the cursor |
| Search for text | In Command Mode, type `/word` | Finds "word" in the file |

---

## Example of Full Work

Suppose you want to create a new file and write something:

1. Open `vi`:
   ```bash
   vi hello.txt
   ```

2. Press `i` to **start typing**.

3. Type your text:
   ```
   This is my first vi file.
   ```

4. Press `Esc` to **stop typing** (back to Command Mode).

5. Save and quit:
   - Type `:wq`
   - Press `Enter`

**Done!** You just created and saved a file with `vi`.

---

## Why is `vi` Powerful?

- It is **always available**.
- It **uses less memory** (works on old computers too).
- It is **super fast** once you practice.

Even today, many professionals use `vi` because it‚Äôs very efficient for coding and server management.

---

# The Unix Shell (Detailed and Simple)

---

## What is a Shell?

- A **shell** is a **program** that **connects you** (the user) with the **Unix operating system**.
- You **type commands**, and the shell **runs them**.
- The shell **shows the results** on your screen.

Think of the Shell as:
- **Your assistant**: You give an order ‚Üí The assistant does it.

---

## How Shell Works (Easy View)

1. You type a command like `ls`.
2. Shell sends this command to the Unix system.
3. Unix executes the command.
4. Shell shows the output to you.

---

## Popular Shell Types

| Shell Name | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **sh** | The original shell (Bourne Shell) |
| **bash** | Improved shell (Bourne Again SHell) ‚Äî Most common today |
| **csh** | C Shell, looks like the C programming language |
| **ksh** | Korn Shell, very powerful for scripting |

**Most people today use `bash` shell** because it is simple and powerful.

---

## Common Shell Commands

You can **do many things** using shell commands:

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `pwd` | Show current location (directory) |
| `ls` | List files and folders |
| `cd foldername` | Move into another folder |
| `mkdir newfolder` | Create a new folder |
| `rmdir foldername` | Remove (empty) folder |
| `rm filename` | Remove a file |
| `cp oldfile newfile` | Copy a file |
| `mv oldfile newfile` | Move or rename a file |
| `cat file.txt` | Display file content |
| `echo "Hello"` | Show text on screen |

---

## More About Shell

The shell is **not just for running simple commands** ‚Äî it can also **run scripts**.

---

### What is a Shell Script?

- A **Shell Script** is a **file that contains many shell commands**.
- Instead of typing commands one-by-one, you **put them into a script file** and **run it**.

Example:

**1. Create a file named `myscript.sh`**:

```bash
vi myscript.sh
```

**2. Inside, write:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
date
ls
```

**3. Save and exit (`:wq`).**

**4. Make the script executable:**
```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

**5. Run the script:**
```bash
./myscript.sh
```

**Output will be:**
```
Hello, World!
[shows current date and time]
[list of files]
```

---

## Shell Environment Variables

Shell uses **variables** to store temporary data:

| Variable | What it Stores |
|:---|:---|
| `HOME` | Your home directory location |
| `PATH` | Where the system looks for programs |
| `USER` | Your username |

You can see them using:

```bash
echo $HOME
```
or
```bash
echo $USER
```

---

## Why Shell is Very Important

- **Automate work** (scripting).
- **Manage files and system** easily.
- **Control servers** remotely.
- **Customize** your Unix/Linux environment.

Without shell, using Unix would be very slow and difficult!

---

# Final Summary (Cheat Sheet)

| Topic | Summary |
|:---|:---|
| **vi Editor** | Tool to create, edit, save files. Two modes: Command and Insert. Commands like `:wq`, `dd`, `/search`, `yy`, `p`. |
| **Shell** | Program that runs your commands and shows results. You can create folders, files, run programs, or automate tasks. |
| **Shell Scripting** | Writing many commands inside a file and running it automatically. |

---

# A Small Real World Example:

Suppose you are working on a server:

1. You use the **shell** to log in and check server status.
2. You open configuration files using **vi editor** to make changes.
3. You write a **shell script** to backup files every night automatically.

This is how Unix/Linux admins work every day!

# Where Does `vi` Fit In?

**`vi` is a program that you run through the Shell.**  
It helps you **edit files** in the **File System**.

### So:

1. You **type** `vi file.txt` in the Shell.
2. The **Shell** starts the `vi` editor program.
3. `vi` allows you to **create/edit/save** text files.
4. Files are stored in the **File System**.

**Flow when using `vi`:**

```
You ‚Üí Shell ‚Üí Start vi ‚Üí Edit File ‚Üí Save to File System
```

---

# Full Example (Real Life Steps)

Let's say you want to write a note on your server:

1. **You open Terminal** (Shell starts automatically).
2. You type:
   ```bash
   vi notes.txt
   ```
   (Shell starts the `vi` editor)

3. Inside `vi`:
   - Press `i` to insert.
   - Write:
     ```
     Meeting at 5 PM today
     ```
   - Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` to save and quit.

4. Now your file **notes.txt** is saved in your system.

**Everything done with simple commands!**

# Part 1: What is the Shell Process in Unix?

---

## 1. What is a "Process"?

- A **process** is simply a **program that is running**.
- When you open a program or command, Unix **creates a process**.
- Example:  
  - When you run `vi notes.txt`, the **`vi` editor becomes a process**.
  - When you run `ls`, **listing files becomes a process**.

---

## 2. What is a "Shell Process"?

- The **shell** itself is also a **program**.  
- When you open a **Terminal** (command line), the **shell process starts**.
- This shell waits for your commands.

**Simply:**
- **Shell** is **a special process** that **takes your commands**, **sends them to Unix**, and **shows you the results**.

---

## 3. How the Shell Process Works (Simple Step-by-Step)

Here‚Äôs what happens in simple language:

1. **User opens Terminal** ‚Üí A **Shell Process starts**.
2. **User types a command** (like `ls`).
3. **Shell reads the command**.
4. **Shell creates a new process** for that command.
5. **Unix does the job** (like listing files).
6. **Shell shows the result** on screen.
7. **Shell waits for the next command.**

---

### Diagram View:

```
[User types command] 
       ‚Üì
[Shell reads command]
       ‚Üì
[Shell creates new process to run the command]
       ‚Üì
[Command runs and finishes]
       ‚Üì
[Shell shows output and waits for next command]
```

---

## 4. Types of Processes Started by Shell

There are **two types of processes**:

| Type | Explanation | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Foreground process** | Runs directly in front; you wait until it finishes. | Running `vi file.txt` |
| **Background process** | Runs in the background; you can keep working while it runs. | Running `backup.sh &` |

**Tip:**  
To run something in the background, you **add `&`** at the end.

Example:

```bash
./long_task.sh &
```

---

## 5. Managing Shell Processes

You can control processes:

| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `ps` | Show all processes |
| `jobs` | Show background jobs |
| `kill PID` | Kill (stop) a process by its PID (Process ID) |
| `fg` | Bring background job to foreground |
| `bg` | Send stopped job to background |

**Example:**
```bash
ps
```
shows a list of running processes.

---

# Part 2: Customizing the Shell Environment

---

## 1. What is the Shell Environment?

- The **Shell Environment** means **settings** that control **how the shell behaves** for you.
- You can **customize** it to:
  - Change how your command prompt looks.
  - Set shortcuts for commands.
  - Set the default editor (`vi` or `nano`).
  - Set your favorite directories or paths.

---
  
## 2. Environment Variables

- **Environment Variables** are **like settings** stored inside the shell.
- They control things like:
  - Where programs are found.
  - Your username.
  - Your home directory.
  - Which editor opens by default.

---

### Some Important Environment Variables:

| Variable | Meaning | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `HOME` | Your home directory | `/home/username` |
| `USER` | Your username | `alex` |
| `PATH` | Where to look for commands | `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin` |
| `SHELL` | Which shell you are using | `/bin/bash` |
| `EDITOR` | Default text editor | `vi` or `nano` |

---

## 3. How to See Environment Variables

- To see all environment variables:

```bash
printenv
```
or
```bash
env
```

- To see a specific variable:

```bash
echo $HOME
```

It will show your home directory.

---

## 4. How to Set Environment Variables

If you want to **set a new variable** or **change an existing one**, you can do:

```bash
export VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

Example:

```bash
export EDITOR=vi
```
This sets your default editor to `vi`.

**Note:**  
- This change is **temporary** (only for current Terminal session).

---

## 5. Making Changes Permanent

To make environment changes **permanent**, you have to put them inside special files.

For **bash shell**, these files are:

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `~/.bashrc` | Settings for every new terminal window |
| `~/.bash_profile` | Settings for login shell (when you log in) |

You can edit `.bashrc` like this:

```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
```

And add a line like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/username/myprograms
```

After saving, apply changes using:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or simply restart the terminal.

---

## 6. Customizing the Shell Prompt (`PS1`)

You can change **how your terminal prompt looks** using the `PS1` variable.

Example:

```bash
export PS1="[\u@\h \W]$ "
```

- `\u` = username
- `\h` = hostname
- `\W` = current directory

This will show a prompt like:

```
[alex@server Documents]$
```

You can make your prompt colorful and stylish!

# What is Shell Programming?

---

- **Shell programming** (also called **Shell scripting**) is the **art of writing a group of Unix commands** into a **text file**.
- Later, you can **run that file** like a small **program**.
- Instead of typing commands one by one every time, you write all commands in a file and **run the file**.  
**It saves time and makes work automatic!**

---

# Why Shell Programming is Useful?

- **Automation**: You don't need to manually type 10‚Äì20 commands again and again.
- **Batch Processing**: Do lots of work (copy files, backups, cleanups) with just **one click**.
- **Simple Programming**: Shell programming is much easier than C, Java, or Python.
- **System Administration**: All system admins use shell scripts to manage servers.

---

# Example of What Shell Programming Does

Suppose every morning you:
- Login
- Check disk space
- Check memory
- List today's files

Instead of typing 4 commands every day,  
**you can write a shell script once, and run it every morning with one command!**

---

# How to Create a Shell Program (Step-by-Step)

---

### Step 1: Open a text editor (like `vi`)

Example:

```bash
vi myscript.sh
```

---

### Step 2: Write the script

Inside the file, write:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a simple shell script

echo "Good Morning!"
date
df -h
free -m
```

**Explanation:**
- `#!/bin/bash` ‚Üí Tells Unix this is a bash shell script.
- `#` ‚Üí Anything after `#` is a **comment** (just for information; shell ignores it).
- `echo` ‚Üí Prints text on screen.
- `date` ‚Üí Shows current date and time.
- `df -h` ‚Üí Shows disk space (in human-readable format).
- `free -m` ‚Üí Shows memory usage (in MB).

---

### Step 3: Save and Exit

- In `vi`, press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and hit Enter.

---

### Step 4: Make the script executable

You must give permission to run the script:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

---

### Step 5: Run the script

Now you can run it:

```bash

# Important Parts of Shell Programming

---

## 1. Comments

- Use `#` to write comments (notes for humans).
- Comments are **ignored by the shell** when running the script.

Example:

```bash
# This script checks the server health
```

---

## 2. Variables

- You can **store data** in variables.

Example:

```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name"
```

- This will print:
```
Hello, John
```

**Important**: No spaces on both sides of `=` when setting a variable.

---

## 3. Taking Input from User

You can **ask user** to enter something:

Example:

```bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read username
echo "Welcome, $username"
```

When you run it:
- It will ask for your name.
- It will welcome you.

---

## 4. Decision Making (if-else)

You can **make decisions** inside scripts.

Example:

```bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]
then
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "Number is 10 or smaller."
fi
```

**Explanation:**
- `-gt` means "greater than."
- `[ ... ]` are needed around the condition.

---

## 5. Loops

You can **repeat things** using loops.

**For loop example:**

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

**While loop example:**

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

This keeps running while `count <= 5`.

---

# Types of Shell Programs (Simple Examples)

---

| Type of Script | What it Does | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Startup script | Runs when the system starts | Launch servers, load settings |
| Backup script | Takes backup of files | Copy important files daily |
| Monitoring script | Watches system health | Check CPU, memory, disk usage |
| Automation script | Repeats tasks automatically | Rename files, send emails |

---

# Real-World Mini Example: Backup Script

Suppose you want to copy your "project" folder every day to a backup folder.

Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cp -r /home/user/project /home/user/backup/project_$(date +%F)
echo "Backup completed at $(date)"
```

- `cp -r` ‚Üí Copy folder.
- `$(date +%F)` ‚Üí Current date like `2025-04-29` (nice for naming).
- `echo` ‚Üí Print message.

Run this script every evening to **automatically backup your project**!

# What is the Unix File System?

---

- The **Unix File System** is **how Unix organizes and stores files and folders** on a disk (like your hard drive or SSD).
- Think of it like a **big tree** with **branches** (folders/directories) and **leaves** (files).
- **Everything in Unix is treated like a file** ‚Äî even things like:
  - Text files
  - Programs
  - Devices (like your keyboard, printer)

**So in Unix, EVERYTHING is a file!**

---

# Important Characteristics of Unix File System

---

- Organized like a **tree** with **root at the top** (`/`).
- Files and folders are arranged **in levels** (like a family tree).
- Each file has:
  - A **name**
  - A **location (path)**
  - **Permissions** (who can read/write/execute it)
- Special directories have special meanings.
- Files can be:
  - Normal files (text, programs, images)
  - Directories (folders)
  - Device files (to control hardware)

---

# Structure of Unix File System

---

The Unix file system is like this:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ var
```

**Explanation:**

| Folder | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `/` | Root (the top-most directory) |
| `/bin` | Essential programs (commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/boot` | Files needed to start (boot) the computer |
| `/dev` | Files that represent devices (disk, printer) |
| `/etc` | Configuration files (settings) |
| `/home` | Home folders for all users |
| `/lib` | Essential system libraries (help programs run) |
| `/media` | Temporary mount points for external devices (USBs) |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (automatically deleted later) |
| `/usr` | User programs and files |
| `/var` | Variable data like logs, emails |

---

# Important Directories (explained simply)

---

### `/`
- Root folder.  
- Everything starts from here.

### `/bin`
- **Binary files** (ready-to-run programs) like:
  - `ls` (list files)
  - `cat` (display file contents)

### `/home`
- This is **where your personal files live**.
- Example:
  - `/home/alex/Documents`
  - `/home/john/Pictures`

Each user has a **separate folder** inside `/home`.

### `/etc`
- Contains **configuration files** for:
  - Network
  - Users
  - Programs
- For example, system settings files like `/etc/passwd`.

### `/dev`
- Special files for devices.
- Example:
  - `/dev/sda1` ‚Üí Your hard drive.
  - `/dev/usb1` ‚Üí Your USB drive.

### `/tmp`
- Temporary files.
- Programs put short-term files here.
- Files here are deleted after a reboot.

---

# How Paths Work in Unix File System

---

There are two types of **Paths**:

| Path Type | Example | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Absolute Path** | `/home/alex/file.txt` | Full path from root `/` |
| **Relative Path** | `Documents/file.txt` | Path from where you are now |

**Absolute Path** always starts with `/`.  
**Relative Path** depends on your **current directory**.

---

# Types of Files in Unix

---

In Unix, **everything is a file**, but there are different types:

| File Type | Meaning | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Regular file** | Text, programs, images | `/home/alex/note.txt` |
| **Directory** | A folder (contains files) | `/home/alex/` |
| **Device file** | Represents hardware | `/dev/sda1` |
| **Link** | Shortcut to another file | `/home/alex/shortcut_to_note` |
| **Socket** | Special file for communication | Used in networking |
| **Pipe** | Connects output of one program to input of another | `|` symbol usage |

---

# Important Commands to Work with Files and Directories

---

| Command | What it does | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `ls` | List files and directories | `ls /home/alex` |
| `cd` | Change directory | `cd /home/alex/Documents` |
| `pwd` | Show current location (path) | `pwd` |
| `mkdir` | Make a new directory | `mkdir newfolder` |
| `rmdir` | Remove a directory | `rmdir emptyfolder` |
| `rm` | Remove files or directories | `rm file.txt` |
| `cp` | Copy files | `cp file1.txt file2.txt` |
| `mv` | Move or rename files | `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` |

---

# How File Permissions Work

---

Each file/folder has **permissions** for:

- **Owner** (the person who created the file)
- **Group** (a team of users)
- **Others** (everyone else)

**Permissions types:**
- `r` ‚Üí Read
- `w` ‚Üí Write (edit)
- `x` ‚Üí Execute (run)

Example:

```bash
-rwxr-xr--
```
means:
- Owner can read, write, and execute.
- Group can read and execute.
- Others can only read.

**Command to see permissions:**

```bash
ls -l
```

**Command to change permissions:**

```bash
chmod 755 file.txt
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/ (your files)
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alex/
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ john/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/ (devices)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/ (temporary files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr/ (user programs)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ var/ (logs, emails)
```

# Simple Summary Table

| Concept | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| **Everything is a file** | Even hardware is shown as a file. |
| **Root `/`** | The starting point of all files and folders. |
| **Home `/home/user`** | Your personal files and folders are stored here. |
| **Important folders** | `/bin`, `/etc`, `/dev`, `/tmp`, `/usr`, `/var` |
| **File permissions** | Control who can read/write/run a file. |

---

# Final Easy Words:

- The **Unix File System** is **like a tree** starting from **root `/`**.
- It **organizes everything neatly** ‚Äî files, programs, devices.
- **You move inside it** using commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`.
- **Permissions** decide **who can access files**.

# What are Unix Commands?

---

- **Unix commands** are **small instructions** you type in the **terminal** to tell the computer **what you want it to do**.
- For example:  
  - Show files
  - Copy files
  - Move folders
  - Check system information
  - Manage users, and much more.

**In short:**  
> Unix commands are **your way of talking to the Unix system**.

---

# Basic Unix Commands (with easy explanations)

---

Here‚Äôs a list of **very important and basic commands**:

| Command | Meaning | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `pwd` | Show your current location (path) | `pwd` |
| `ls` | List files and folders | `ls` |
| `cd` | Change directory (move to a folder) | `cd Documents` |
| `mkdir` | Make a new folder (directory) | `mkdir myfolder` |
| `rmdir` | Remove an empty folder | `rmdir myfolder` |
| `rm` | Remove (delete) files or folders | `rm file.txt` |
| `cp` | Copy files or folders | `cp file1.txt file2.txt` |
| `mv` | Move or rename files or folders | `mv file.txt Documents/` |
| `cat` | Show contents of a file | `cat file.txt` |
| `more` | View long files page by page | `more file.txt` |
| `touch` | Create an empty file | `touch myfile.txt` |
| `echo` | Print a message on the screen | `echo "Hello World"` |
| `whoami` | Show your username | `whoami` |
| `date` | Show current date and time | `date` |
| `cal` | Show calendar | `cal` |
| `clear` | Clear the terminal screen | `clear` |

---

# Simple Example

Suppose you open a terminal and type:

```bash
pwd
```
Output:
```
/home/alex/Documents
```
(Shows you are inside `/home/alex/Documents` folder.)

Now, if you type:

```bash
ls
```
It will list all files and folders in the Documents directory.

---

# What are Attributes in Unix?

---

- **Attributes** describe **special properties** of a file or folder.
- They decide:
  - **Who can read** the file
  - **Who can write** (change) the file
  - **Who can execute** (run) the file

**Example attributes are:**
- **Permissions** (`r`, `w`, `x`)
- **Ownership** (who owns the file)
- **File size**
- **Creation/Modification date**

---

# How to View File Attributes

You can see the attributes using the command:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 alex users  4096 Apr 29 10:30 notes.txt
```

**Let‚Äôs break this down:**

| Part | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `-rw-r--r--` | File permissions |
| `1` | Number of links (not very important now) |
| `alex` | Owner (who created the file) |
| `users` | Group (which group the owner belongs to) |
| `4096` | Size of file in bytes |
| `Apr 29 10:30` | Last modification date and time |
| `notes.txt` | File name |

---

# Understanding File Permissions Simply

Permissions look like this:

```
-rwxr-xr--
```

Meaning:

| Who | Permissions | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Owner** | `rwx` | Owner can **read**, **write**, and **execute** |
| **Group** | `r-x` | Group can **read** and **execute** |
| **Others** | `r--` | Others can only **read** |

**Legend:**
- `r` ‚Üí Read
- `w` ‚Üí Write (modify)
- `x` ‚Üí Execute (run)

---

# How to Change Permissions and Ownership

---

## To change permissions:

```bash
chmod 755 myfile.txt
```
- `7` = `rwx` (read, write, execute for owner)
- `5` = `r-x` (read, execute for group)
- `5` = `r-x` (read, execute for others)

## To change ownership:

```bash
chown newowner myfile.txt
```

Changes the owner of the file.

---

# Special Important Commands for Files

---

| Command | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `stat file.txt` | Shows full details (size, modified date, permissions) |
| `file file.txt` | Shows type of file (text, image, etc.) |
| `find /home/alex -name notes.txt` | Find a file inside a folder |

---

# Very Quick Example Session

You open your terminal and do:

```bash
pwd
```
‚Üí Shows your location.

```bash
mkdir newfolder
```
‚Üí Creates a new folder.

```bash
cd newfolder
```
‚Üí Move into the new folder.

```bash
touch hello.txt
```
‚Üí Create an empty file.

```bash
ls -l
```
‚Üí See the file‚Äôs attributes (permissions, owner, size).

# What is Unix?

---

- **Unix** is an **operating system** that manages the hardware of your computer and provides an environment to run programs and applications.
- It's **multi-user**, meaning **multiple people** can use it at the same time (in different sessions).
- **Unix** was created in **1969** by **Ken Thompson**, **Dennis Ritchie**, and others at **AT&T Bell Labs**.
- Today, **Unix-like operating systems** such as **Linux** and **macOS** are widely used.

---

# Why is Unix Special?

---

1. **Multitasking**:  
   - Unix allows you to run **multiple tasks (programs)** at the same time.  
   - For example, you can browse the internet, write a document, and play music **all at once**.

2. **Multi-user**:  
   - **Multiple users** can log into the system and work independently at the same time.
   - Each user has their own **files**, **settings**, and **permissions**.

3. **Security**:  
   - Unix has a strong system of **permissions** that controls who can access and modify files.
   - Users can be restricted from accessing each other's data or system settings.

4. **Portability**:  
   - Unix can run on many types of computers, from small devices to supercomputers.  
   - This is because it is designed to be **portable** and can be easily adapted to different hardware.

---

# Basic Structure of Unix

---

Unix has a **simple and efficient structure** that helps organize data and manage tasks. It works like a **tree** where everything is connected.

### The Unix file system looks like this:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ var/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/
```

### What do these folders mean?

| Folder | What it Contains |
|:---|:---|
| `/` | The **root directory** (top-most level). All other files are beneath it. |
| `/bin` | Essential system programs (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`). |
| `/etc` | Configuration files that control system settings. |
| `/home` | User directories (for personal files). |
| `/usr` | User programs and software. |
| `/var` | Files that change frequently (logs, databases). |
| `/dev` | Device files (represent physical devices like hard drives). |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files used by programs. |

---

# Key Features of Unix

---

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**:  
   - The **Unix shell** is a command-line interface where users type commands to perform tasks.
   - Example commands: `ls` to list files, `cd` to change directories.

2. **Shell**:  
   - The **Shell** is the program that interprets the commands you type and **communicates** with the kernel (the core of the operating system).
   - The **Bash shell** is the most common shell used today in Unix-like systems (like Linux and macOS).

3. **File System**:  
   - In Unix, **everything is a file**, whether it's a **text file**, a **program**, or even a **device**.
   - Files are organized in a **hierarchical structure**, meaning folders can have other folders or files inside them.

4. **Processes**:  
   - A **process** is a program that is running on your system.  
   - Unix allows you to run multiple processes at the same time and control them using commands like `ps` (to see running processes) and `kill` (to stop a process).

5. **Networking**:  
   - Unix supports **networking** features, allowing it to connect to other computers over the internet or local network.
   - You can easily **transfer files**, **share resources**, and even **remote login** to other systems using commands like `ssh` (Secure Shell).

---

# Unix Command Structure

---

Unix commands follow a simple pattern:  
```
command [options] [arguments]
```

Example:
- `ls -l /home/alex`  
  - **`ls`**: Command to list files
  - **`-l`**: Option to show detailed information (like size, permissions)
  - **`/home/alex`**: Argument specifying the folder to look into

---

# What is the Kernel?

---

The **kernel** is the **heart** of the Unix operating system. It:
- Manages the **hardware** (like CPU, memory, devices).
- Controls **resources** (disk space, RAM, etc.).
- **Communicates** between software (programs) and hardware.

When you run a program, the shell talks to the kernel, which makes sure that the **right resources** are used to run that program.

---

# Who Uses Unix?

---

Unix is used by many types of organizations, especially:
- **Servers**: Unix is commonly used on servers, handling thousands of requests every second.
- **Developers**: Programmers use Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS) for coding, testing, and deploying software.
- **Scientists/Engineers**: Unix is also popular in fields like **science** and **engineering** due to its power and flexibility.

---

# Basic Commands to Get Started

Here are some of the **most basic commands** that every Unix user should know:

| Command | Meaning | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `pwd` | Show your current directory | `pwd` |
| `ls` | List the contents of the current directory | `ls` |
| `cd` | Change directory (move to a folder) | `cd Documents` |
| `cp` | Copy files or directories | `cp file1.txt file2.txt` |
| `mv` | Move or rename files | `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` |
| `rm` | Remove files or directories | `rm file.txt` |
| `touch` | Create a new empty file | `touch newfile.txt` |
| `cat` | Display the contents of a file | `cat file.txt` |

---
